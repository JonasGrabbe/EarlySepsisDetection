Sepsis is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in hospitals. Early diagnosis could substantially improve the patient outcomes and reduce the mortality rate. However, while professional critical care societies have proposed new clinical criteria that aid sepsis recognition, the fundamental need for early detection and treatment remains unmet.
This resume is the first draft to outline how one could proceed in developing an MLA solution for questions like: early detections, survival or length of stay.  The data we have access to at the moment the the PhysioNet 2019 Challenge dataset which consists of 40k UCI patients with 40-time dependent features.
